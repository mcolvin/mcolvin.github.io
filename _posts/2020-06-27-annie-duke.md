It was one of those NPR car moments when there was something
super interesting on but I just got to the grocery store and
the Mississippi sun keeps you from hanging out in the car to 
listen. It was an old episode of [Radio Lab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/segments/278173-dealing-doubt) 
with an interview
with Annie Duke---Dealing with doubt. The doubt in this context
is uncertainty. If you don't know who Annie Duke is, she was 
a very good professional poker player retiring in 2012 to focus
on strategic decision making [https://www.annieduke.com/](https://www.annieduke.com/).
Her book [Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When 
You Don't Have All the Facts](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions-ebook/dp/B074DG9LQF/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=annie+duke&qid=1593292710&sr=8-2)
is a great read and some very interesting parallels to natural 
resource management can be draws because we rarely have 
the luxury of certainty and management actions are at time
a bet that the action will achieve the desired outcome. 



The 19 minute interview can be found below. At about 3 minutes in
Annie was asked 

>"What do you do in the case when there aren't any signals to read
>the only thing you really know is nothing?" 
>
>>"Well actually what you sort of figure out is that you don't need to know
>>The real breakthrough moment for me was when I stopped trying to figure 
>>out anything with certainty" 
 
The question gets at what many natural resources managers
are trained as scientists which comes with the objective 
to know things with certainty. In contrast a manager
often does not have the luxury of knowing the potential 
outcome of a management action with certainty but must
make a decision anyways. That is where making smart 
decisions is important and realizing you can't science the 
shit out of something but you must make a decision.

 
Worth a listen
in my opinion to think about uncertainty and decision making.
