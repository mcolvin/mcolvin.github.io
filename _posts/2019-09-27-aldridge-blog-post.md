Post by [Caleb Aldridge](https://aldridgecaleb.github.io/).---This is a 
recent paper wirtten for a directed study course on the philosophy and 
application of estimation. The thoughts are my own and do not 
neccessarily reflect those of my lab.

The beginning of the 21stcentury coincided with the explosion of the 
Information Age, a period marked by economies based on information and 
information technology. The shift within the past decade can be likened 
to growth of an understory tree racing to fill a gap in the canopy. With 
this new age has come expansion in computer sensors, technology, and 
collection of data. The interrelated fields of ecology, conservation 
biology, and natural resources management, hereafter “ecology” for 
convenience, traditionally and exclusively required manual methods to 
capture data, but new sensors and technologies have changed how and how 
much data are collected. Application of data-driven techniques (i.e., 
machine learning) to handle the deluge of data has ignited interesting 
discussions regarding scientific reasoning and ecological management 
(Kelling et al., 2009; Peters et al., 2014). In the following essay I 
highlight: (1) the history of scientific processes; (2) the balance of 
understanding and prediction; and (3) the role of philosophy of science 
in applied ecology. 


### A Brief History of Scientific Processes

Reasoning typically takes three forms: deduction, induction, and 
abduction. Deductive logic proceeds from the general to the singular 
(e.g., all whales are blue; George is a whale; therefore George is 
blue). Inductive logic proceeds from the set to the general (e.g., 98% 
of whales sampled are blue; it is expected that most all whales are 
blue, including George the whale). Abductive logic proceeds from 
specific to general and seeks the most likely explanation (e.g., Anne, 
Percy, and Toni are whales and are blue; George is a whale; it is likely 
that George is also blue). Deduction is the preferred method of 
reasoning as it leaves no room for uncertainty, but ecologist typically 
are not privileged with complete knowledge of the population and must 
use inference to gain knowledge about the world. 


Both historically and contemporarily, two approaches to understanding 
have been used: hypothesis-driven (H-D) and data-driven (D-D). The H-D 
approach can be generally characterized by moving from theory or ideas 
to data (Kell & Oliver, 2003). Advocates for the H-D approach include 
Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke, Thomas Chamerlin, John Platt, and Karl 
Popper (Elliott et al., 2016). The D-D approach can be generally 
characterized as moving from data to ideas (Kell & Oliver, 2003). 
Advocates for the D-D approach include Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, 
William Whewell, and John Stuart Mill (Snyder, 1999; Elliott et al., 
2016). The popularity of one approach or the other has waned since the 
17thcentury (Elliott et al., 2016). Contemporary views include a more 
nuanced, iterative approach to filling knowledge gaps—a D-D helps 
discover patterns and generate hypotheses in light of data and theory 
that are then tested in a H-D framework, which then garners support from 
additional observation and may imply new hypotheses. This contemporary 
view aligns with Hilborn and Mangel (1997), “...we bring to the 
problem whatever techniques–from wherever the come–needed to solve 
it.” 


See Elliott et al. (2016), Kell and Oliver (2003), Peters et al. (2014), 
Elliot (2012), Kelling et al. (2009), and Fudge (2014) for further 
details. 


### *N* is Only Part of a Study’s Strength

A large amount of data and methods for discovering patterns can do well 
for predicting and generating hypotheses, but causal inference must be 
approached more carefully to establish. As Hernán, Hsu, and Healy 
(2019) state, “...the validity of causal inferences... depends on the 
adequacy of expert causal knowledge.” And sometimes, models can be 
theory based and lead to strong inference but be less accurate than a 
“wrong” model (Shmueli, 2010; Platt, 1964; Fudge, 2014; Kelling et 
al., 2009). The best models from a scientific perspective are those that 
allow for powerful explanation and powerful prediction. 


Three important considerations for any ecologist when balancing between 
understanding and prediction are: (1) know the objectives of one’s 
study, (2) know the context of one’s study, and (3) know one’s data, 
whether it has or is yet to be collected. Elucidating these will help 
the ecologist strengthen their study and meet its purpose (Elliott et 
al., 2016; Nichols & Williams, 2006; Williams, Nichols & Conroy). 


### Management and Knowledge Discovery
The idea of knowing one’s objectives, context, and data is echoed by 
Nichols and Williams (2006), though they perhaps over-emphasize the 
necessity of hypotheses in management. (They themselves pull back on the 
throttle in the “Caveats” section). A focus in Gregory et al. 
(2012), Conroy and Peterson (2013), and even latter chapters of 
Williams, Nichols, and Conroy (2002) take a more nuanced approach, 
suggesting that the ecologist carefully balance understanding and 
prediction— this balance from a modeling perspective is discussed by 
Shmueli (2010). 


If one considers H-D and D-D approaches struggle over an element of 
efficiency, not just logic and virtue, one can envision science and 
management progressing forward using the approaches iteratively. (This 
struggle of efficiency is also a focus in Nichols and Williams (2006) as 
they contrast targeted and surveillance monitoring). Indeed, adopting 
elements of the D-D approach into adaptive management (AM) might prove 
to be even more efficient. Per the structured decision making (SDM) and 
AM framework, the need for information would initiate a D-D approach to 
generate new hypotheses that would then be considered in light of theory 
and tested via the H-D approach. 


### Closing Comments

Both H-D (i.e., deductive and focused more on explanation or parts) and 
D-D (i.e., inductive/abductive and more focused on prediction or 
systems) approaches have made large and important contributions to 
scientific knowledge. There are encampments about which is superior or 
if the other is valid. I prefer to view each as necessary to scientific 
progress and complimentary to one another (e.g., Darwin’s collecting 
of specimens from which he inductively inferred evolution by natural 
selection that was then tested in a hypothetico-deductive approach). 
This shifts the focus to addressing the knowledge gap or challenge and 
the approaches or methods necessary to do so (Elliott et al., 2016; 
Shmueli, 2010; Kell & Oliver, 2003; Peters et al., 2014; Elliott, 2012; 
Kelling et al., 2009; Hilborn & Mangel, 1997; Glass & Hall, 2008).
