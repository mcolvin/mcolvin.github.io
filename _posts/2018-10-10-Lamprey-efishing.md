## Chasing Southern Brook Lamprey

Yesterday the WFA4313 Fisheries Management class went out
to a local stream to try to find some Southern Brook Lamprey
_Ichthyomyzon gagei_. The gang did a 3 pass depletion on 
95 meters of stream. Overall each pass took 1.2, 0.51, and 0.6 hours
for each pass respectively. The catch varied with each pass and
they captured 26, 18, and 16 lamprey for each pass. The last pass is a
bit inflacted becuase there were several smaller, presumably 1 yo
lampreys captured. Check out the video below to see some of the fun.
