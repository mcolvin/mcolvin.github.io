## Overview and Objectives

To date, I have not found something comparable to the outputs of Netica in R. Not
to say there are not packages that do just what I am doing, I just have not been able to 
do what I wanted to with them. Also I wanted to take some of the curtain back on how Bayesian 
networks are solved and can be solved using R. 

The objectives of this post are to 

1. Calculate marginal probabilities for nodes in a Bayesian network
1. Solve a Bayesian Decision Network in R

## About

In this example I will step through how to solve the Bayesian decision network (BDN) below which was
demonstrated in Conroy and Peterson (2013), Figure 1 below. This post assumes familiarity with BDNs.

_Figure 1. Compiled Bayesian decision network that was replicated in R._ 

For each of the lettered nodes in Figure 1 there are conditional probably
tables associated with each. The code below reads in the CPT for each node.
Note this may be a vector of probabilities for nodes like C or a table of 
the probabilities of all the possible outcomes for a node like D. 



```r
A<-read.xlsx("bdn-tables.xlsx",sheet="current number wetlands")
A[,-c(1)]<-A[,-c(1)]/100
```
I took the numbers directly from the CPT for A in Netica, copy and paste, 
which are reported as % so the second line of code converts all the 
percentages to probabilities varying from 0 to 1. Below is what the A table 
looks like 


```r

## 22                 15 0.000281078
```

Now I repeat the process for all the lettered nodes in Figure 1. I do not have to 
anything for the decision or utility node. In this case the utility is simply 
the probability of persistence x 100 which is easy enough to calculate in R. 
If there were elicited values then that table would need to be imported 
as well. The code below imports the remaining nodes and coverts them 
to probabilities. 


```r
B<-read.xlsx("bdn-tables.xlsx",sheet="number of wetlands")
B[,-c(1:2)]<-B[,-c(1:2)]/100
C<-read.xlsx("bdn-tables.xlsx",sheet="Current wetland colonization pr")
C[,-1]<-C[,-1]/100
D<-read.xlsx("bdn-tables.xlsx",sheet="Wetland colonization probabilit")
D[,-c(1:2)]<-D[,-c(1:2)]/100
E<-read.xlsx("bdn-tables.xlsx",sheet="Wetland persistence probability")
E[,-1]<-E[,-1]/100
F<-read.xlsx("bdn-tables.xlsx",sheet="prob. spp. persistence")
```

Here is how a more complicated node that is the child of 2 parents looks.

B

## Solving the BDN

To solve the BDN I need to work iteratively from parent to child node and 
calculate the marginal probabilities for each parent node to combine
with the CPT of the child node. The marginal probabilities are the belief
bars that are illustrated for each node in Figure 1.  

### Marginal probability of wetland colonization probability (B)

The marginal probability for node B (Number of wetlands) is calculated by combining the 
probability for current number of wetlands (A) and conditional on 
the management decision. Now the management decision does not effect
the current number of wetlands but it does influence the future number of
wetlands (B) as you can see in the CPT for B above. The trick to doing the 
calculations efficiently is to use matrix multiplication. Some quick notes 
on the matrix multiplication. 

* the dimensions of B is 22 rows by 11 columns
* the dimensions of A is technically 11 rows by 1 column for the 11 states in 
node A, but above it has 22 rows!
* the number of decisions is 2

For the matrix multiplication to work A must be 22 rows by 1 to match 
the number of rows in B. Why 22? Well this is because of the decision node
is connected to node B and therefore we need to repeat the probabilities for 
A to account for each decision! Now it is efficient to 
use matrix multiplication to multiply the marginal probabilities of A and the 
conditional probabilities of B as below. Note I am doing the matrix multiplication
only on the probabilities. 


```r
# marginal probabilities for B
B_mp<-t(B[,-c(1,2)])%*%A[,-1] ## probability of each outcome given the inputs
# divide by the sum to 
B_mp<-B_mp/sum(B_mp) # the denominator is the marginal likelihood, serves to normalize and sum to 1
# for easy handling later.
B_mp<-data.frame(state=names(B[,-c(1,2)]),prob=B_mp)
```

The marginal probabilities for B are the same as the ones specified in 
figure 1. Cool beans. 


```r
B_mp
```

```
##    state        prob
## 5      5 0.152030152
## 6      6 0.131504031
## 7      7 0.110334337
## 8      8 0.196606849
## 9      9 0.162898512
## 10    10 0.110595162
## 11    11 0.067171590
## 12    12 0.036785601
## 13    13 0.018301072
## 14    14 0.008577902
## 15    15 0.005194791
```

### Solving the rest of the nodes

Now to solve the rest of the model you simply keep working iterative from 
parent to child node until you get to the end! The code below does for node D
that. 


```r
# marginal probabilities for D
D_mp<- t(D[,-c(1,2)])%*%C[,-1]
D_mp<-D_mp/sum(D_mp)
D_mp<-data.frame(state=names(D[,-c(1,2)]),prob=D_mp)
D_mp
```

```
##           state        prob
## 0-0.2     0-0.2 0.570384868
## 0.2-0.4 0.2-0.4 0.292496288
## 0.4-0.6 0.4-0.6 0.103609503
## 0.6-0.8 0.6-0.8 0.028355151
## 0.8-1     0.8-1 0.005154191
```

Node F is a bit more complicated because there are 3 parent nodes (E, D, B). 
But we first identify all the possible combinations of E, D, and B. Then 
we assign the marginal probability for E and D calculated above and since 
B is a just a vector or probabilities we use it.  



```r
# marginal probabilities for F
parents<-list(D_mp,B_mp,E)
tmp <- lapply(parents,function(x){1:nrow(x)})
tmp<- expand.grid(tmp)
```

Now we need to make sure the order of our combinations match 
the CPT we extracted for F from Netica. 


```r
tmp<- tmp[order(tmp[,1],tmp[,2],tmp[,3]),]
```

Now that is taken care of we assign the correct probability to
each state in `tmp`. 


```r
parents_probs<- tmp
parents_probs[,1]<- parents[[1]][tmp[,1],]$prob
parents_probs[,2]<- parents[[2]][tmp[,2],]$prob
parents_probs[,3]<- parents[[3]][tmp[,3],]$prob
```

The product of the rows of `parents_probs` should
sum to 1. Let's confirm. 


```r
sum(apply(parents_probs,1,prod))
```

```
## [1] 0.9999995
```

Now that we have the probability for each possible outcome of
node B, D, and E we can use matrix multiplication to calculate 
the marginal probability for node F of Figure 1. 


```r
F_mp<- t(F[,-c(1:3)])%*%apply(parents_probs,1,prod)
F_mp<-F_mp/sum(F_mp)
F_mp
```

```
##               [,1]
## persist 0.07165562
## extinct 0.92834438
```

The utility value is now F_mp times 100. Note that this will be a different 
calculation if the utility is not a calculated value (i.e., elicited values). 


```r
U<-F_mp*100
U
```

```
##              [,1]
## persist  7.165562
## extinct 92.834438
```

But the values of U do not match the numbers in the decision box! What is going
on there? Well we need to solve the network for each decision to get the decision
specific utility. The utility above is essential the expected utility if you 
did not know what decision to do. 


## Solving the network for each decision

### Decision: improve connectivity
To solve the network for each decision we 
just need to 'turn off' each decision and solve the matrix. This is easily done 
by zeroing out the probabilities associated with the decision. Based on Figure 1 the 
the decision influences node D and B and therefore we need to add a vector to those
calculations to represent the decision. The code chunks below solve the BDN if
the decision was to 'improve connectivity' and 'restore wetlands' respectively.  

First thing we are going to do is make a vector to hold our utilities. 


```r
# utility values: H
U<- rep(0,2) # utility for each decision
```

Now we can solve the BDN for the first decision. 


```r
## decision == improve connectivity
decision<-"Improve connectivity"
# marginal probabilities for B
dec<-ifelse(B[,1]==decision,1,0)
B_mp<-t(B[,-c(1,2)]*dec)%*%A[,-1]
B_mp<-B_mp/sum(B_mp)
B_mp<-data.frame(state=names(B[,-c(1,2)]),prob=B_mp)
### marginal probabilities for D
dec<-ifelse(D[,1]==decision,1,0)
D_mp<- t(D[,-c(1,2)]*dec)%*%C[,-1]
D_mp<-D_mp/sum(D_mp)
D_mp<-data.frame(state=names(D[,-c(1,2)]),prob=D_mp)
### marginal probabilities for F
parents<-list(D_mp,B_mp,E)
tmp <- lapply(parents,function(x){1:nrow(x)})
tmp<- expand.grid(tmp)
tmp<- tmp[order(tmp[,1],tmp[,2],tmp[,3]),]
parents_probs<- tmp
parents_probs[,1]<- parents[[1]][tmp[,1],]$prob
parents_probs[,2]<- parents[[2]][tmp[,2],]$prob
parents_probs[,3]<- parents[[3]][tmp[,3],]$prob
F_mp<- t(F[,-c(1:3)])%*%apply(parents_probs,1,prod)
F_mp<-F_mp/sum(F_mp)
```

And now we grab the utility


```r
U[1]<- F_mp[1]*100
```

The marginal probabilities calculate above should all be close to the marginal
probabilities in Figure 2 below.

### Decision: restore wetlands 
 
Now on to the next decision


```r
## decision == restore wetlands
decision<-"Restore wetlands"
# marginal probabilities for B
dec<-ifelse(B[,1]==decision,1,0)
B_mp<-t(B[,-c(1,2)]*dec)%*%A[,-1]
B_mp<-B_mp/sum(B_mp)
B_mp<-data.frame(state=names(B[,-c(1,2)]),prob=B_mp)
### marginal probabilities for D
dec<-ifelse(D[,1]==decision,1,0)
D_mp<- t(D[,-c(1,2)]*dec)%*%C[,-1]
D_mp<-D_mp/sum(D_mp)
D_mp<-data.frame(state=names(D[,-c(1,2)]),prob=D_mp)
### marginal probabilities for F
parents<-list(D_mp,B_mp,E)
tmp <- lapply(parents,function(x){1:nrow(x)})
tmp<- expand.grid(tmp)
tmp<- tmp[order(tmp[,1],tmp[,2],tmp[,3]),]
parents_probs<- tmp
parents_probs[,1]<- parents[[1]][tmp[,1],]$prob
parents_probs[,2]<- parents[[2]][tmp[,2],]$prob
parents_probs[,3]<- parents[[3]][tmp[,3],]$prob
F_mp<- t(F[,-c(1:3)])%*%apply(parents_probs,1,prod)
F_mp<-F_mp/sum(F_mp)
```

And we now get that utility. 


```r
U[2]<- F_mp[1]*100
```

The values are darn close to the values in 
Figure 1 of 4.1 and 8.0. 


```r
U
```

```
## [1] 4.309007 9.287041
```


There is some
discrepancy on the last utility 9.2 versus 8.0, which i think is due to some rounding errors in the CPT of D. 
The marginal probabilities calculate above should all be close to the marginal
probabilities in Figure 2 below.
