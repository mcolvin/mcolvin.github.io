Summer has past and fall semester is upon us. Time for the semester lab meeting. 

Recall the syllabus for students enrolled in WFA8000 credits. It can be found [here](https://mcolvin.github.io/WFA8000-Research-Credits/syllabus.html).

Also we will keep the same format as spring semester students enrolled in WFA8000 credits
need to do 2 blog posts and an end of semester video. Remember they should be 
2-3 minutes, not 20 minutes!

At the first one on meeting of the semester be sure to have your semster report ready!

Let's go for another great semester!
