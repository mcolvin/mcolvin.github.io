The Fort Peck Environmental Impact Statement was released! [PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Sep/24/2002861498/-1/-1/1/FPDTR_FEIS__MAIN_EIS.PDF)

Lab personnel contributed significantly to chapter 2 that links expected long-term 
pallid sturgeon population dynamics to dam operations through hydrodynamic models
[Section 2.2.3](https://media.defense.gov/2021/Sep/24/2002861498/-1/-1/1/FPDTR_FEIS__MAIN_EIS.PDF#page=[56]).
