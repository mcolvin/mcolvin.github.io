Today I learned that `prod()` function in JAGS is not 
as fast as I expected. It runs out in a analysis that
took ~70 seconds, an additional 10 seconds was added for 
each use of `prod()`. May not make a hill of beans in a 
small analysis that is done in less than 2 minutes, but
I am needing analyses that scale. Any performance
improvement is important! So by 
spelling out the multiplication inline as

`1-(p[i,1,1,1]*p[i,2,1,1]*p[i,3,1,1]*p[i,4,1,1]*p[i,5,1,1])`

versus 

`1-(prod(p[i,1:5,1,1])`

was a good performance boost, enough to move forward with 
for future analyses.
