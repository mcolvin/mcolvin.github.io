Itâ€™s been one week since we surgically implanted PIT tags into 36 
Frecklebelly Madtoms.

Today, undergraduate student (Rick Campbell) and 
postdoc (David Schumann) returned to Private John Allen National Fish 
Hatchery to check on the fish.

So far, so good. Only one fish has died 
as a result of the procedure and every other fish has retained their 
tag. The incision wounds have healed rapidly and many are hardly 
noticeably after only seven days!
