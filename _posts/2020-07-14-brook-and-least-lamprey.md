Looking through some fish occurrence data and stumbled into something
interesting, at least to me and those of us who have been messing around 
with Southern Brook Lamprey _Ichthyomyzon gagei_ (Figure 1). In the headwaters of the 
Noxubee River there are 2 species of lampreys that have been identified 
the southern brook lamprey and the least brook lamprey _Lampetra aepyptera_ (Figure 2)
in proximity to each other. 

This raises a couple of questions.

1. Are they truly different? What are the characters that are used in
field to differentiate the 2. 
2. Assuming reliable field identification, do they co-occur? If they 
do why might that be? If they do not, why might that be?
3. We can do a pretty good job catching ammocoetes, but if we do can
we tell them apart?
