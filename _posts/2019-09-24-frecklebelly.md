A great day out in the field with WFA4313 Fisheries Management Lab. We
sampled a large gravel bar on the Tombigbee River with the MDWFP Ichthyologist. 


We caught 57 Frecklebelly Madtoms _Noturus munitus_ and a Fawnsfoot mussel.



The class getting to sample. It was good and warm, low 90s but at least the water was a few degress cooler.

Results of an hour of intense kick electrofishing. Several darter species, a couple of madtom species, including
the target species, and few shiners. A good haul!
