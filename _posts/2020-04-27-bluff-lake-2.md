As coronavirus sweeps across the U.S. and the workforce is stripped down to only essential employees, many people are left at home. With most storefront entertainment options, like movies, gyms, malls, zoos, and theme parks closed, more people are turning to the outdoors after becoming restless in their isolation. If you manage to make it out for a drive to your closest state park, you might see more people camping, fishing, and hiking. 

This revival of interest in the outdoors is amazing! However, this renewed passion should be treated with caution. As people have less time to dedicate to their jobs, they’re more able to invest their time in other passions and what would otherwise be healthy habits. While outside in nature, you can still find yourself  meeting potentially infected individuals or encountering surfaces they’ve touched. Also, participating in an outdoor activity  doesn’t always mean that you will be practicing social distancing. For example, check out the image below of what fishing can look like at a trout park in Missouri. If you think it’s a wonderful day to go on a hike or go fishing, you can probably assume several other people had that same idea

Focusing on fishing (because I’m a fish person), let’s talk about how to go about this hobby safely for both yourself and others. First, if you’re sick, or you have been in contact with someone that is sick, STAY HOME. Second, only go to local areas. This is not a time for you to travel and check out a new area. Third, if you make it to the area and the ramp or bank is crowded, find another area, or go home. If you do find a space, make sure that you are at least 6 feet away from the neared person and continue to practice frequent handwashing and other sanitary measures. 

Many cities and states have chosen to take very different actions regarding outdoor activities. For example, Michigan is encouraging fishing as a safe outdoor activity, while Missouri has waived fishing licenses for a two week period, until April 15th. However, states like Oregon and Washington have closed all recreational fishing in some or all areas. Make sure to follow your local guidelines before heading out.
