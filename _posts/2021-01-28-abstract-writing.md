With the start of the new year the calls for abstracts to present at 
local, regional, and national meetings are either already going or coming 
down the pipe. One of the challenges as a student and professional for that 
matter is crafting an abstract for a presentation. In most cases, the presentation
will represent work that is ongoing or will happen before the meeting. So without
a first draft of a paper abstracts can be challenging! But with a bit of a formulaic 
approach the abstract can come together relatively quickly. The formula below, shared
with by [Dr. Schumann](https://daschumann.github.io/) has proved useful to students to
get that first abstract draft. There are 8 parts with each part roughly equating to 
1 or more sentances. 

1. Generalized topic statement 
2. Hone in on topic/need/issue 
3. Identify the exact topic and/or describe the “hole” in our understanding 
4. State how this study aims to fill the “hole”: what is/was your objective? 
5. 2-3 sentences of study design and field methodology 
6. 1-2 sentences of analytical techniques 
7. Result(s) 1-3 sentances
8. Implication, management recommendation, or what is the broader application of your result(s) (1 sentance)

A good strategy is to first take the 8 parts and fill them in wiht coordination of 
your advisor or mentor. Then craft the abstract. **Note the formula is not a hard or 
fast rule, you may need to consolidated sentances to get to the word limit.** The formula
helps ensure you have the appropriate elements and then content can be consolidated as 
needed. Most abstracts are approximately 250 works, some may go as high was 300 and others 
may be as low as 125. But because you have 300 words to work with it does not mean you need to
use all of them!

One last point on presentation abstracts. The title is what folks will look at to 
see of they want to attend. In almost all cases what is presented in the abstract will
not wholly match that talk, alot can happen between the time the abstract is due and the actual talk!
So don't fret if your end presentation doesn't match your abstract, but do spend some time 
coming up with a good title that captures where you think you will be and can reasonably match
the end presentation. 

In closing, the abstract is imporant to get you to the stage to present and the title is important to
get folks to come to the stage!
