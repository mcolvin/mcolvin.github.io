# Evaluating the fish assemblage and fishery of Bluff Lake and integrating fishery objectives with Paddlefish and bird management objectives to evaluate water level management decisions

Bluff lake is an important impounded lake located in the Noxubee 
National Wildlife Refuge (NNWR). The lake is primarily managed to 
achieve NNWR objectives for shore and waterbirds; however, it is also 
among few local systems to provide angling opportunities to nearby 
residents and Mississippi State University students. Anecdotally, Bluff 
Lake was a productive fishery that satisfied local anglers, and it is 
suggested that varying length limits on sportfish harvest over time 
improved the fishery. The NNWR 
Comprehensive Conservation Plan acknowledges that 
recreational fishing opportunities are negatively impacted by the water 
level manipulations used to achieve duck and wood stork habitat 
objectives. Additionally, water releases from Bluff Lake are necessary 
to facilitate the ranging behaviors of Paddlefish located in the pool 
below the Bluff Lake spillway. By drawing down 
the reservoir mid-summer, moist soils plants grow to provide duck forage 
and isolated pools trap fish for summering wood storks. Water releases 
are also used to provide passage along Oktoc Creek for Paddlefish. 
However, these draw-downs restrict the habitat available to fishes of 
angler interest and limit other recreational uses. Water management 
decisions compete for a dynamic yet finite amount of water annually, but 
little is known about the tradeoffs among these decision alternatives. 

# Specific research questions for this project are:

1. How does the current Bluff Lake fish assemblage compare to the past fish assemblage?
2. Does summer drawdown of Bluff Lake result in hypoxic or anoxic areas?
3. How much water is in Bluff Lake at varying lake levels?
4. What is the current angler usage, harvest, and angling objectives?
5. What is the objective hierarchy of competing Bluff Lake water uses?
