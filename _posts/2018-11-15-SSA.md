Over the past week Drs Colvin and Schumann of the fisheries management 
and fish conservation lab at Mississippi State University (R) had the 
unique opportunity to interact with the USFWS species status assessment 
framework implantation team (SSA-FIT) at a workshop in Tuscon, Arizona. 
The objective of the meaning was to evaluate tools intended to increase 
SSA capacity at the agency level. The meeting was a tremendous learning 
experience, specifically learning how SSAs are done in all the USFWS 
regions and how listing decisions are made! The FM&FC team presented a 
brief overview of tools being developed to assist SSAs. For a background 
about the tools see the project website 
[here](https://mcolvin.github.io/SSA-DST). 


Overall the trip was long and exhausting but in that good way where 
there was so much good information and input received!
