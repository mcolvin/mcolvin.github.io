Introduction
------------

In part of the scientific writing process one sometimes overlooked but
important aspect to the final document is the captioning of figures and
tables. These are as important, if not more than the actual figure or
table because they explain and provide the necessary context to
understand what is displayed in a figure or table. Importance aside, it
is easy to wait to the last minute to write out the captions, but at
least in my workflow, I can’t really focus on the results for the main
text until the figures and tables are settled. Inevitably the figures
and tables change in terms of the information presented or order as part
of the writing process and your thoughts unfold, but that does not
preclude tackling the caption and getting it done!

Anatomy of a caption
--------------------

Technical scientific writing is purposely standardized in many respects.
Most articles follow the IMRaD format with an Introduction, Methods,
Results, and Discussion where we know exactly where to look for the
information we as a reader might be interested in. The caption for a
figure or table is not much different, there too is a standard format
that organizes the information in the caption.

A figure or table caption contains at least 1 sentence that describes
the figure or data broadly and includes where and when the data is
collected if necessary. The last ‘if necessary’ might be a bit unclear
but what that means is that you might not need to report about the
location or the time when the data was collected if it is reported in
the figure or table. Below is an example of a study area figure, figure
1 in Herrala et al. (2014).

Below is an another example of, figure 3 in Herrala et al. (2014). It is
a 2 panel figure there the first sentence of the caption describes each
panel along with the temporal and spatial context.

The figure below is an example from Koch et al. (2014), figure 1
therein, that has multiple panels. The first sentence describes the x
and y axes each panel and the temporal and spatial context.

For example the caption for the table below from Quist et al. (2011)
provides a broad overview of the data and a location but there is no
information about when the data was collected as this is contained in
the table itself.

A checklist for a figure or table caption
-----------------------------------------

While there is no perfect formula for a figure or table caption the
guidelines below should assist in writing out those pesky captions.

1.  A first sentence that broadly describes the data and reports when
    the data was collected and where, unless that information is covered
    in sufficient detail in the figure and table.
    1.  In the broad description for a figure concisely describe the
        figure type (e.g., barplot, boxplot, scatterplot, lineplot),
        what is reported on the x-axis and the y-axis. Use your best
        judgment here, it may not be necessary to describe things that
        are commonly known like months or years.
    2.  There might be multiple panels and so denoting in the caption
        differences in top and bottom panels or each panel if they are
        denoted by letters or numbers.
2.  Sentences in addition to the first sentence including
    1.  Descriptions of any relevant information needed to understand
        the figure like what symbols mean
    2.  What abbreviations mean
    3.  What colors mean.
    4.  Additional sentences needed to describe there may be other
        information presented in a figure like
        1.  lines denoting standard errors or 95% confidence intervals,
            and
        2.  values of interest, or the quartile ranges of a boxplot.
