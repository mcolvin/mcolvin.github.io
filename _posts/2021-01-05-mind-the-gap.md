Recently I have migrated from my trusty old red notebook and
bullet type journal system to keep track of my to do list to 
a web based program called [focuster](https://next.focuster.com/).
I did so because I was becoming a bit overwhelmd with my notebook 
system. I still believe there is utility in carrying a notebook
and the tactile nature of writing something down. It is way faster
than trying to look up something on your smartphone. That said, 
in my notebook I had a 2 part system, a yellow post-it that captured
all things I needed to do and each page I would bullet out what I was
going to do in a day. At times I would find myself spinning my tires 
trying to determine what to do from the list and it is easy to lose 
focus and do the easy stuff first and then by the end of the day 
the meaningfull bits remain unaccomplished. Enter focuster.

I have tried other online systems, omnifocus, my life organized,
trello, tools in GitHub but they all seemed like a digital version 
of my notebook with the nicer organization. In addition to my 
notebook I lived and die by my [calendar](https://mcolvin.github.io/calendar). 
I make my calendar viewable
to students and others online which really cuts down on the multiple 
emails needed to schedule a meeting. So when meetings occur then 
no work can really be scheduled. So a system the allows one to
work with a caledare and 'schedule' work is what is needed on my end.
I want to be able to account for existing meetings and then have tasks
scheduled in the open blocks. That is what Focuster does. One neat thing 
that you can visualize on calendar there is where 'gaps' occur in your
day, illustrated below.

The gaps in a time block schedule can arise from 2 sources: 1) a task took longer than you allocated or
2) you were doing another task that was not on your daily timeblocks. Either way at the end of day
you can see where your workflow might be in need of a tune up or some adaptation to 
daily rythms or how to allocate tasks more approprately to the time needed to complete.
