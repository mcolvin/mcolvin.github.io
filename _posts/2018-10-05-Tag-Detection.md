# The effects of sediment on PIT tag detection-The setup

Sometimes tagged fish aren't detected because they aren't there. 
Sometimes they're just really good at hiding, even from low-frequency 
radio signals. The Southern Brook Lamprey (_Ichthyomyzon gagei_) burrows 
in sand and soft sediment, presumably to avoid predation and unfavorable 
environmental conditions. But from our recent experiment, the depth of 
the PIT tag within the substrate plays a role in it's detection 
probability. We're planning to couple this experiment with others to 
better understand this complication and how we might, if we can, 
mitigate it. 


Below is the PIT tag reader with two types of antenna.

Below are PIT tag analogs, sealed inside plastic straws, secured to the 
bottom of a plastic container. Sand was added in 3 cm increments
after each scan to estimate the depth at which we could no longer
detect the tags.

Below is a top view of the container after approximately 12 cm of sand has been added.

Now on to looking at the results!
