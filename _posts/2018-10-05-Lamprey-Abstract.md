Abstract for an upcoming talks at the Southeastern Fishes Council
meeting at McCormick, South Carolina November 8-9, 2018

The southern brook lamprey (_Ichthyomyzon gagei_) is a 
primitive, nonparasitic, filiform fish that inhabits streams of the 
Southeastern USA. Little is known about the species, especially in their 
cryptic larval form (i.e., ammocoetes) which burrow into fine sediment. 
The presence of southern brook lamprey populations suggest good stream 
quality; they may also help maintain stream integrity (e.g., nutrient 
cycling). As part of a comprehensive study of southern brook lamprey 
ecology in Mississippi, we surgically implanted passive integrated 
transponder (PIT) tags into the peritoneal cavity of ammocoetes. 
Although short-term survival and tag retention was high (100%), the 
percentage of released individuals detected in subsequent sampling 
efforts was low compared to hidden PIT tag analogs (5.36 ± 0.04 % and 
66.07 ± 0.10 %, respectively). To understand, in part, this 
discrepancy, we varied sediment depth (0–30 cm; 3 cm intervals) above 
analogs in laboratorium. At each interval we measured the response of 
each analog, detected (1) or not (0), with a PIT tag reader. The analogs 
were then measured at the same depth intervals but without sediment 
(i.e., control). We modeled analog detection as a function of substrate 
type and depth to describe the influence of ammocoete burrowing behavior 
on the detections of tagged individuals. Substrate type (eß = 0.04 , 
Wald’s χ2 = 17.84, p = <0.01) and depth (eß = 0.64, Wald’s χ2 = 
37.75, p = <0.01) affected the detection probability of analogs. The 
estimated detection probability of analogs at 12 cm (typical ammocoete 
length) in sand was estimated at 41.7% compared to 95.2% in no 
substrate. Further investigation into ammocoete burrowing habits will 
improve expected detection probabilities and sampling approaches. This 
experiment provides a small but needed piece of information when using 
PIT tags in studying and conserving this unique species.
