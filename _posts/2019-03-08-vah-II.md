Disease outbreaks in aquaculture can often ultimately end in mass 
mortality events. However, few people every really consider the dynamics 
of what is happening during a disease outbreak. This can things such as 
the actual transmission of a pathogen from one individual to another, 
the management actions of a pond owner, different rates of mortalities, 
etc. All of these factors play into the length and magnitude of an 
outbreak. 


Below is a simplified representation of the progression of an _Aeromonas 
hydrophila_ disease outbreak in farm-raised Channel Catfish (_Ictalurus 
punctatus_). In this image, the boxes represented &quot;number of 
individuals&quot; in each state (susceptible, infected, recovered, or 
dead). The red arrows indicate how the different variables relate to one 
another; and the circles represent modifiers such as the rate of 
transmission or mortality rates.

Combining models, such as the one above, with knowledge about the 
system, we can start to simulate different conditions and predict how 
the population of fish will respond to a disease outbreak. Using the 
model from the image above, I set some basic rules for how I want the 
system to behave based on regular management strategies of catfish 
farmers. For instance, I set a rule that if more than 100 dead fish were 
seen on the pond in a given day, then the farmer should switch to 
medicated feed (shown as &quot;Medicated&quot; in the model above). 
After setting my starting constraints, I ran a simulation to see how the 
pond and fish population would respond over a 7-day period. The output 
from the simulation is shown in the graph below. As you can see, the 
farmer switched to medicated feed (yellow, line 4) 2 days after the 
disease outbreak began; however, fish continued to die from the disease 
for another day or so (pink, line 2). This makes sense because 
individuals that are heavily infected will still likely die before the 
medication in the feed can fight off the pathogen.

This is just one small example of the power of these models and the 
types of questions that we can begin to explore with them. In the 
future, I will continue to build on this model and explore different 
strategies that farm managers may be able to use to limit the number of 
fish lost to _Aeromonas hydrophila_ disease outbreaks, and, potentially, 
how different strains of the disease behave within the catfish 
aquaculture ponds.
