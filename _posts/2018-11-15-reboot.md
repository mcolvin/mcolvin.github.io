New peer-reviewed publication out. This publication documents
the structured decision making process we used to identify 
stakeholder objectives for a large scale monitoring program for
Missouri River pallid sturgeon. Certainly was an undertaking and 
the outcomes of the process are documented in the report 
that can be found [here](https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20181166).
