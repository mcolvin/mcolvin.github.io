Location: Clear Lake, Iowa

The purpose of this project is to understand the effects of introduced 
common carp and invading zebra mussels on water quality and the native 
fish, invertebrate, and plant communities in Clear Lake, and to organize 
this knowledge into a simulation model for predicting future changes and 
the outcomes of management actions. The resulting model will enable 
prediction of the effects of both biotic and abiotic factors on water 
quality in Clear Lake, and facilitate evaluation of a variety of 
scenarios and management alternatives for future water quality.
