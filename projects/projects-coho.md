Location: Coast Range Western Oregon

Freshwater water habitat has been identified as a major factor limiting 
smolt production. Legacy land use impacts have reduced and simplified 
instream habitat required by juvenile coho to survival high overwinter 
flows. Overwinter survival has been associated with size of coho parr 
going into the winter period and the amount of flow refugia. 


This was large-scale analysis project evaluating factors associated with:

* mark-recapture of PIT tagged coho salmon
* factors associated with end of summer parr abundance and weight
* factors associated with overwinter survival
* intermittent stream use by juvenile coho salmon
