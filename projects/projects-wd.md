Location: May, Idaho

The parasite _Myxobolus cerebralis_ has been implicated in the declines 
of salmonid species in the west. We observed a high degree of fluvial 
disruption in the Pahsimeroi River drainage. We found evidence that 
fluvial disruptions did exist before the settlement of the valley by 
Europeans and exacerbated since then. We used data from sentinel 
exposures conducted from 2001-2003 to evaluate factors hypothesized to 
affect the distribution and intensity of _M. cerebralis_, the causative 
agent of salmonid whirling disease. We observed no patterns in infection 
severity consistently relating to abiotic variables. Over time we 
observed a variable infection in the middle Pahsimeroi River reach 
ranging from none to severe _M. cerebralis_ pathology. On the lower 
Pahsimeroi River reach, we observed a consistent detectable pathology. 
We compared information gathered on the fish distributions and relative 
abundance to sentinel exposure results to evaluate the possible role of 
the salmonid host on infectivity of _M. cerebralis_. We observed 
differences in fish compositions in stream reaches that may be linked to 
_M. cerebralis_ infection dynamics.
