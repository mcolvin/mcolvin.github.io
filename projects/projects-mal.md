About
Malheur National Wildlife Refuge was established on August 18, 1908 by 
President Theodore Roosevelt as the Lake Malheur Bird Reservation. 
Roosevelt set aside unclaimed lands encompassed by Malheur, Mud and 
Harney Lakes as a preserve and breeding ground for native birds. The 
newly established Lake Malheur Bird Reservation was the 19th of 51 
wildlife refuges created by Roosevelt during his tenure as president. At 
the time, Malheur was the third refuge in Oregon and one of only six 
refuges west of the Mississippi. 


Background and context

Common Carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) first invaded Malheur Refuge in the late 
nineteen thirties or early forties. The Silvies River provided them 
access to Malheur Lake where they became a nuisance ten years later. 
During the next ten years carp migrated up the Blitzen River and invaded 
the Blitzen Valley wetlands. Their spread to the Double-O unit of the 
refuge was temporarily restricted by the natural land bridge between 
Harney and Mud Lakes. But during the years of 1952, 1957 and 1958 the 
natural barrier was breached, allowing carp to invade the Double-O unit 
wetlands also. By the early 1960's carp were established in large 
numbers throughout the refuge, and began to have an adverse impact on 
the aquatic habitat and production of submerged aquatic plants and 
aquatic invertebrates. These aquatic plants and invertebrates are 
important food items for native fish, waterfowl, shorebirds and other 
water birds. 


While carp search for aquatic invertebrates they compete directly with 
other aquatic wildlife by consuming and uprooting submerged aquatic 
plants. These plants, especially sago pondweed (_Potamogeton pectinatus_), 
are important foods for other wildlife and provide a critical part of 
the subsurface habitat used by aquatic invertebrates and native fish. 
Carp alter the aquatic ecosystem when feeding by causing water 
turbidity. While feeding on the bottom, they vigorously roil the water 
in search of food which stirs up the sediment and organic material and 
resuspend this material in the water column. Consequently, subsurface 
sunlight needed for plant growth is reduced, and photosynthetic plant 
production and oxygen levels decrease. With high concentrations of carp, 
the effects of swimming and spawning also contribute to increased 
turbidity. Eventually carp can change the physical environment of an 
entire aquatic ecosystem to a turbid water state. (This background is 
from Vetter 1995)
