Length limits have been implemented by fisheries management agencies to 
achieve population density, size structure, and angler satisfaction 
objectives. By redirecting harvest towards or away from particular 
length- or age-groups, length limits rely on harvest by anglers to 
maintain a population at or near a desired state. The fish population 
changes that follow the implementation of harvest regulations may take 
several years to manifest, so long-term monitoring may be needed to 
adequately evaluate length limits. We used an innovative application of 
cluster analysis to facilitate evaluation of the effects of three 
consecutive length limits on a population of Largemouth Bass _Micropterus 
salmoides_ over a 28-year period in Ross Barnett Reservoir, Mississippi. 
A 13â€“16-in protected slot length limit (10 years), followed by a 15-in 
minimum length limit (MLL; 11 years), followed by a 12-in MLL (7 years) 
failed to restructure the Largemouth Bass population due to what we 
suggest was the expansion of a voluntary catch-and-release attitude that 
started in the first decade of the study period. Various population 
metrics shifted towards values expected in an unharvested population, 
and the observed shifts can be attributed to a harvest deficit created 
by the prevailing catch-and-release attitude. Largemouth Bass harvest 
regulations may no longer be relevant in many waters. The utility of 
regulations for restructuring Largemouth Bass populations is largely 
dependent on harvesting attitudes that vary geographically, depending on 
cultural characteristics and demographics.
