## New student and employee checklist

The following items are generally ordered in priority.

1. Get an id at Allen Hall. You will need an ID and your offer letter.
1. Get a parking permit if needed
1. Get your training taken care of. See [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10sV-VlTd4xO3EY5_d8SYCYE6dDa4FN0RFTj5FbgzOqE/edit?usp=sharing)
for a list of trainings and how to do them. They may be contingent on getting a netid and some 
of the things associated with your school ID.
