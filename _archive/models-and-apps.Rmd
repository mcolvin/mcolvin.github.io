## Models and Apps

Models have facilitated both research and management of aquatic systems. 
Various models have been developed that can be used by stakeholders to 
evaluate management or used in a formal structured decision making or 
adaptive resource management framework. Models developed can be read and 
simulated using ISEE Player which is freely available at: 
http://www.iseesystems.com/softwares/player/iseeplayer.aspx. 


### Malheur NWR carp management

This model was developed to support decisions of carp population control 
for Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Burns, Oregon. Malheur NWR 
is a complex system of aquatic resources that has seen declines in 
waterfowl production due to water quality declines. Common carp have 
been identified to limit water quality in this system; however 
management difficult of these interconnected populations is difficult. 
This model develops 6 main interconnected common carp populations that 
are subject to harvest. Robustness of management strategies (i.e., carp 
removal) to varying degrees of population connectedness can be 
evaluated.

### CarpBioDyn

CarpBioDyn is a tool to evaluate common carp biomass suppression by 
commercial harvest. This is production model for a research model that 
fitted a semi-discrete biomass dynamics model to a time series of common 
carp biomass estimates and indices (i.e., CPUE) via maximum likelihood 
in R. The parameterized model was then constructed in STELLA with a user 
interface so that managers could evaluate management strategies and the 
effect of unintentional underharvest on biomass dynamics. More details 
regarding the development of this model can be found here.

### CLESM

CLESM is a tool to evaluate the effects varying non-native species 
dynamics and restoration on water quality, recreational fishery yield, 
and primary production in an ecosystem context for a shallow eutrophic 
lake in Iowa. Specifically, the model was developed to assess the 
impacts of common carp and a recent invasion of zebra mussels on an 
economically and recreationally important lake, Clear Lake located in 
north central Iowa.
